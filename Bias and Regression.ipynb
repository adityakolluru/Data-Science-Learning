    "- You can have the fanciest math and regression model in the world but if there is an underlying bias in your data and you don't know why, it is all for not.\n",
    "- Always take time to understand what the variables mean.\n",
    "- Forms of bias\n",
    "    - Selection Bias\n",
    "        - How did you come by your data? What values are included? What values are not included?\n",
    "    - Publication bias (File drawer problem)\n",
    "        - Only those with significant results get to publish their results. How reliable and reproducible are those results?\n",

    "In the 1936 election between Rosevelt and Langdon, Reader's Digest surveyed 2.3 Million Americans to see who would win the election. They estimated that Langdon would win by a landslide based on the survey results. They were horribly wrong. Why?\n",

    "- Lombard collected data on a number of professions and found the average life expectancy of those professionals. What he found in the results were quite alarming but what he later realized is that he was subject to selection bias.
